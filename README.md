# Dining Concierge Chatbot #

## About ##

Customer Service is a core service for a lot of businesses around the world and it is getting disrupted at the moment by Natural Language Processing-powered applications.

It is a serverless, microservice-driven web application. Specifically, you will build a Dining Concierge chatbot that sends you restaurant suggestions given a set of preferences that you provide the chatbot with through conversation.
